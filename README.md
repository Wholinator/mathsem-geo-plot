# mathsem-geo-plot

This repository houses the final project for the Mathematics Senior Seminar class
of Spring 2017 at NWMSU for my group: Matthew Wholey and Liz Conard.

The assignment was to basically just explore the data available for Nodaway County.
We were given great freedom in what we wanted to do with the project. Some ideas we
had were quantifying the impact of a single job, discovering job flow for different 
industries, exploring the recent change in manufacturing jobs and the effects of
it, etc. 

The data gathering and data cleaning aspects of the project ended up taking most of 
our time as we were given no guidance on where, how, or what data to get. Being a 
team of 2 and only having a semester, we didn't get as far as we'd have liked but
we learned a lot in the process.
